_Abstract:_ Nonbinary people have a gender identity that falls outside the male-female binary. To investigate hiring discrimination against nonbinary applicants, I submitted nearly 8,000 applications to postings in pairs. Treated resumes listed pronouns, and two treatment arms were considered: nonbinary "they/them" and sex-congruent "he/him" or "she/her." Results show disclosing "they/them" reduces employer response by 18\% on average. Using the sex-congruent treatment arm as a disclosure-only benchmark, I decompose the "they/them" effect into a general disclosure penalty and an identity-specific component. I find around two-thirds of total "they/them" discrimination is rooted in nonbinary identity. Discrimination against applicants who disclose "they/them" pronouns is larger in Republican geographies and when job postings list narrow wage ranges.
